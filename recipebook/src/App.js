                Vegetarian cooking is not about taking the meat away and reducing the flavour!
                It can be absolutely amazing and we want to show you the best dishes.
                If youâ€™re trying to broaden your diet and eat more veggies,
                or cooking for a friend who avoids meat, these recipes are too good to pass.
                All recipes are fast and easy to follow, and worth doing even if dining alone.
